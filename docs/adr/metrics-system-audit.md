# Metrics System Architecture Audit

## Context

An architectural review of the metrics system was conducted to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements in the current implementation. This audit focused on data flow, state management, caching strategies, and component architecture.

## Current Architecture

### Data Flow
The system follows a multi-layered architecture:
1. AuthProvider manages user context and health permissions
2. useHealthData hook orchestrates data fetching and caching
3. useHealthCache implements TTL-based caching with AsyncStorage
4. MetricsStore handles data formatting and distribution
5. Display components (Dashboard, MetricCardList, MetricCard) render the data

### Key Components

#### Caching Layer
- Uses AsyncStorage with 5-minute TTL
- Implements race condition protection via AbortController
- Handles cache invalidation on logout
- Missing: Cache size limits and cleanup strategy

#### State Management
- Centralized authentication state
- Integrated health permissions
- Custom hooks for metrics management
- Potential improvement: Consider Zustand for global state

#### Data Synchronization
- Protection against concurrent syncs
- Proper initialization and permission handling
- Potential race condition in simultaneous component mounting

## Strengths

1. **Component Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Reusable metric components
   - Strong typing implementation
   - Efficient animation integration

2. **Error Handling**
   - Distinct permission error handling
   - Isolated health provider errors
   - Graceful cache error degradation

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Memoized metrics calculations
   - Efficient caching implementation
   - Reanimated for smooth animations

## Areas for Improvement

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement cache size limits
   - Add LRU eviction policy
   - Introduce batch updates for metrics
   - Add cache cleanup mechanism

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Add offline support
   - Improve error recovery for partial data
   - Better error messaging

3. **Performance**
   - Reduce permission check frequency
   - Implement batch updates
   - Optimize JSON parsing
   - Add request deduplication

### Long-term Architectural Changes

1. **State Management**
   - Consider migration to Zustand
   - Split AuthProvider into focused providers
   - Reduce context dependencies
   - Implement proper offline support

2. **Data Flow**
   - Implement proper retry mechanisms
   - Add proper cache invalidation strategy
   - Improve permission state management
   - Reduce prop drilling

## Implementation Priority

1. Critical (Immediate)
   - Cache size management
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Permission check optimization

2. Important (Next Sprint)
   - Offline support
   - Error recovery improvements
   - Batch updates

3. Nice to Have (Future)
   - State management migration
   - AuthProvider refactoring
   - Advanced caching features

## Edge Cases to Address

1. **Permission Management**
   - Handle permission revocation during session
   - Manage permission state transitions
   - Improve permission check efficiency

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Handle partial data updates
   - Manage cache invalidation on logout
   - Handle offline data synchronization

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Implement proper retry mechanisms
   - Handle network failures gracefully
   - Manage partial cache updates
