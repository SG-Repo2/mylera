# Architectural Decision Record: Leaderboard and Profile Components

## Context

The MyLera app needs to update its leaderboard and profile pages to:
1. Maintain consistent design language with the Home tab
2. Add expanding/collapsing sections for additional metrics
3. Preserve existing Supabase data fetching patterns
4. Follow Expo Router best practices

## Current Architecture

### Leaderboard Structure
- `src/components/leaderboard/Leaderboard.tsx`: Main component handling data fetching and display
- `src/components/leaderboard/LeaderboardEntry.tsx`: Individual entry component
- Uses React Native StyleSheet for styling
- Integrates with leaderboardService for data fetching

### Profile Structure
- `src/components/profile/Profile.tsx`: Handles profile display and editing
- Uses React Native StyleSheet for styling
- Integrates with AuthProvider and leaderboardService

## Proposed Changes

### Leaderboard Updates
1. Add expandable sections to LeaderboardEntry component
   - Store expanded state using useState
   - Add additional metrics display in expanded view
   - Maintain consistent styling with Home tab

2. Profile Enhancements
   - Add avatar editing capability
   - Improve form handling for profile updates
   - Keep consistent card-based layout with Home tab

### Technical Considerations

1. Styling Approach
   - Current: React Native StyleSheet
   - Proposed: Continue using React Native StyleSheet
   - Reason: Project uses native StyleSheet.create for consistent styling across components
   - Benefits: Better performance, type safety, and native optimization

2. State Management
   - Continue using React's useState for local state
   - Leverage existing AuthProvider for user context
   - Use leaderboardService for data operations

3. Navigation
   - Utilize Expo Router's file-based routing
   - Keep headerShown: false in tab navigation
   - Maintain consistent navigation patterns

## Implementation Plan

1. Update app/(app)/leaderboard/index.tsx
   - Import and use enhanced Leaderboard component
   - Add expandable functionality
   - Maintain consistent styling

2. Update app/(app)/profile/index.tsx
   - Import and use enhanced Profile component
   - Add avatar editing
   - Keep consistent styling

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better user experience with expandable entries
- Consistent design language across tabs
- Improved profile management capabilities

### Negative
- Slightly increased component complexity
- Additional state management for expanded sections

### Neutral
- Maintains existing data fetching patterns
- Preserves current styling approach

## Next Steps

1. Switch to Code mode to implement these changes
2. Update the components while maintaining the architectural decisions
3. Test the new functionality across different devices
4. Document any new props or state management patterns
