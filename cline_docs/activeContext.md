# Active Context

## Current Task
Health data synchronization test improvements and maintenance:

### Recently Fixed Tests
1. iOS Health Integration
   - Fixed "successfully syncs health data on iOS"
   - Fixed "handles initialization failure on iOS"
2. Android Health Integration
   - Fixed "successfully syncs health data on Android"

### Improvements Made
1. Mock Provider Setup
   - Fixed metrics service mock implementation
   - Corrected permission request behavior
   - Improved error state handling

2. Test Reliability
   - Added proper error element handling
   - Fixed async operation timing issues
   - Improved mock implementation consistency

## Recent Changes
- Fixed iOS and Android health data sync tests
- Improved error handling in useHealthData hook
- Enhanced async operation handling with timeouts
- Added proper mock data type validation
- Implemented better error message propagation
- Added authentication verification in metricsService
- Added specific handling for RLS policy violations
- Installed and configured lottie-react-native for error states

## Next Steps
1. Test Coverage Expansion
   - Add tests for edge case scenarios
   - Implement more platform-specific test cases
   - Add stress testing for sync operations
   - Add authentication error test cases

2. Performance Optimization
   - Review and optimize async operations
   - Improve error recovery mechanisms
   - Enhance state management efficiency

3. Documentation Updates
   - Document test patterns and best practices
   - Update API documentation
   - Add troubleshooting guides
