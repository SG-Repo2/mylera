# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
- React Native mobile application
- Platform-specific health integrations (Apple HealthKit, Google Health Connect)
- Custom hooks for health data management
- Integration testing with Jest and React Testing Library

## Key Technical Decisions

### Health Data Integration
- Factory pattern for platform-specific health providers
- Abstract provider interface for consistent API across platforms
- Permission management system with state tracking
- Error boundary pattern for graceful error handling
- Layered initialization with proper error propagation

### State Management
- React hooks for local state management
- Custom useHealthData hook for health data operations
- Async operations with proper loading/error states
- Centralized metrics service for data updates
- Granular error state handling

### Testing Strategy
- Integration tests for health data sync flows
- Mock providers for platform-specific implementations
- Comprehensive error case coverage
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Async operation testing with timeouts
- Platform-specific test suites
- Error propagation verification
- Mock data type validation

## Design Patterns

1. Factory Pattern (HealthProviderFactory)
   - Platform-specific provider instantiation
   - Consistent interface across platforms
   - Error handling standardization

2. Provider Pattern
   - Abstract HealthProvider interface
   - Platform-specific implementations
   - Consistent API contract
   - Error type definitions

3. Hook Pattern (useHealthData)
   - Encapsulated health data logic
   - Loading/error state management
   - Cleanup on unmount
   - Granular error handling
   - Async operation management

4. Service Pattern
   - Metrics service for data operations
   - Centralized update logic
   - Error recovery mechanisms

5. Error Handling Pattern
   - Layered error propagation
   - Platform-specific error mapping
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Recovery mechanisms

6. Testing Pattern
   - Mock provider templates
   - Async operation helpers
   - Error simulation utilities
   - Platform-specific test utilities
