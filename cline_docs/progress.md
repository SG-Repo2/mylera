## In Progress
- Test coverage expansion
  - Edge case scenarios
  - Platform-specific behaviors
  - Stress testing preparation
- Performance optimization planning
  - Async operation review
  - Error recovery mechanisms
  - State management efficiency

## To Do
1. Test Coverage Enhancement:
   - Add stress tests for sync operations
   - Implement edge case scenarios
   - Add platform-specific test cases
   - Expand error handling coverage

2. Performance Improvements:
   - Optimize async operations
   - Enhance error recovery
   - Improve state management
   - Add performance benchmarks

3. Documentation:
   - Document test patterns
   - Create troubleshooting guides
   - Update API documentation
   - Add best practices guide

## Known Issues
1. Performance Considerations:
   - Long-running sync operations need optimization
   - Error recovery could be more efficient
   - State updates may need batching

2. Test Coverage Gaps:
   - Limited stress testing
   - Missing edge case scenarios
   - Platform-specific edge cases needed
   - Authentication error scenarios need coverage

3. Authentication Handling:
   - Need stress testing for auth state changes
   - Consider caching auth state for performance
   - Add retry mechanisms for temporary auth failures
